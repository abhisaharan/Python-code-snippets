Memoization effectively refers to remembering ("memoization" ? "memorandum" ? to be remembered) results of method calls based
on the method inputs and then returning the remembered result rather than computing the result again.
It creates dictionnary to store already computed values and checks when new value inserted that its already
present in dict or not. If yes then it return that value without computation. This increases speed.
